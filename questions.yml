      Python files should have the '.py' extension to be recognized and executed as
      Python code.
  - answer: py
    correct: true
    explanation: The file extension '.py' is the standard file extension for Python
      files. It is used to indicate that the file contains Python code and should
      be interpreted by the Python interpreter.
  overall_explanation: Python files use the '.py' extension to indicate that they
    contain Python source code. Other extensions like '.pi' and '.p' are not valid
    for Python scripts.
  question: Which one of the following is an example of a Python file extension?

    correct: false
    explanation: The list comprehension generates a list with elements from -1 up
      to (but not including) 2. Since the range includes -1, 0, and 1, the resulting
      list will contain three elements, not just two.
  - answer: three
    correct: true
    explanation: The list comprehension generates a list with elements from -1 up
      to (but not including) 2. Since the range includes -1, 0, and 1, the resulting
      list will contain three elements.
  - answer: one
    correct: false
    explanation: The list comprehension generates a list with elements from -1 up
      to (but not including) 2. Since the range includes -1, 0, and 1, the resulting
      list will contain three elements, not just one.
  - answer: zero
    correct: false
    explanation: The list comprehension generates a list with elements from -1 up
      to (but not including) 2. It includes -1, 0, and 1, so the resulting list will
      not be empty and will contain three elements, not zero.
  - answer: four
    correct: false
    explanation: The list comprehension generates a list with elements from -1 up
      to (but not including) 2. Since the range includes -1, 0, and 1, the resulting
      list will contain three elements, not four.
  overall_explanation: The `range(-1, 2)` function produces values -1, 0, and 1, which
    results in a list of three elements. The end value 2 is exclusive, so it is not
    included.

- domain: Data Types
  options:
  - answer: <type 'dict'>
    correct: false
    explanation: The output is incorrect because the code is not dealing with dictionaries
      (dict) in this case. The type() function is specifically used to determine the
      data type of the value passed to it, which in this case is a complex number,
      not a dictionary.
  - answer: <type 'unicode'>
    correct: false
    explanation: The output is incorrect because the code is not dealing with Unicode
      strings in this case. The type() function correctly identifies the data type
      as complex, not Unicode.
  - answer: <type 'float'>
    correct: false
    explanation: The output is incorrect because the code is not dealing with floating-point
      numbers (float) in this case. The type() function correctly identifies the data
      type as complex, not float.
  - answer: <type 'complex'>
    correct: true
    explanation: The output is correct because the code is using the type() function
      to determine the data type of the complex number 1J. In Python, complex numbers
      are represented by adding a 'J' or 'j' after the imaginary part, and the type()
      function correctly identifies it as a complex data type.
  overall_explanation: Python represents complex numbers using the `complex` type.
    A number with an imaginary component, like `1J`, is recognized as a complex number.

- domain: Control Flow
  options:
  - answer: one
    correct: false
    explanation: The code prints a star (*) in each iteration of the while loop, and
      the value of x is divided by 2 (`x //= 2`) in each iteration. The loop will
      run 5 times before x becomes 0, resulting in 5 stars being printed, not one.
  - answer: three
    correct: false
    explanation: The code prints a star (*) in each iteration of the while loop, and
      the value of x is divided by 2 (`x //= 2`) in each iteration. The loop will
      run 5 times before x becomes 0, resulting in 5 stars being printed, not three.
  - answer: The code will enter an infinite loop.
    correct: false
    explanation: The code starts with `x = 16` and prints a star (*) in each iteration
      of the while loop. The value of x is divided by 2 (`x //= 2`) in each iteration.
      Since x is an integer, it will eventually reach 0 after 5 iterations, so the
      code will not enter an infinite loop.
  - answer: five
    correct: true
    explanation: The code starts with `x = 16` and prints a star (*) in each iteration
      of the while loop. The value of x is divided by 2 (`x //= 2`) in each iteration.
      The loop will run 5 times before x becomes 0, resulting in 5 stars being printed.
  overall_explanation: The while loop runs as long as `x > 0`. Each iteration halves
    `x` using floor division (`x //= 2`). Starting from 16, the loop executes 5 times

- domain: Data Aggregates
  options:
  - answer: nums is longer than vals
    correct: false
    explanation: As `vals` is a reference to the list `nums`, appending a value to
      `vals` will also modify the original list `nums`. Therefore, both `nums` and
      `vals` will have the same length, and `nums` will not be longer than `vals`.
  - answer: vals is longer than nums
    correct: false
    explanation: Since `vals` is a reference to the list `nums`, appending a value
      to `vals` will also modify the original list `nums`. As a result, both `nums`
      and `vals` will have the same length, and `vals` will not be longer than `nums`.
  - answer: nums and vals are of the same length
    correct: true
    explanation: When the value 1 is appended to the list `vals`, it is also appended
      to the list `nums` because `vals` is a reference to the same list as `nums`.
      Therefore, both `nums` and `vals` will have the same length after appending
      1.
  overall_explanation: Lists in Python are mutable and stored by reference. Assigning
    `vals = nums` does not create a new list, but instead makes `vals` point to the
    same list as `nums`. Any modification to `vals` will also reflect in `nums`.
  question: 'Take a look at the snippet and choose one of the following statements
    which is true:


    ```python

  options:
  - answer: '6'
    correct: true
    explanation: 'The dictionary `data` treats `1` and `1.0` as the same key, so the
      latest assignment (`1.0: 4`) overrides `1: 1`. The keys in `data` are `{1: 4,
      ''1'': 2}` and the sum of their values is `4 + 2 = 6`.'
  - answer: '3'
    correct: false
    explanation: The output is 6, not 3. The dictionary keys collapse `1` and `1.0`
      into a single entry.

    explanation: The code is valid and executes correctly.
  - answer: '7'
    correct: false
    explanation: The sum of the values in the dictionary is `4 + 2 = 6`, not 7.
  overall_explanation: 'In Python, integer keys and float keys with the same numeric
    value are treated as the same key in a dictionary. Thus, `1.0` overwrites `1`,
    resulting in a dictionary with only two entries: `{1: 4, ''1'': 2}`.'

    explanation: The `+`, `*`, and `in` operators can be used with strings, but `-`
      is not valid for strings in Python.
  - answer: 1, 2
    correct: false
    explanation: The `+` and `*` operators work with strings, but `in` also works,
      so this is incomplete.
  - answer: 1, 2, 4
    correct: true
    explanation: The `+` operator is for string concatenation, `*` repeats a string,
      and `in` checks for substring presence.
  - answer: 1, 2, 3
    correct: false
    explanation: The `-` operator is not valid for strings in Python.
  overall_explanation: String operations in Python include `+` for concatenation,
    `*` for repetition, and `in` for substring checking. However, `-` is not a valid
    string operator.

    explanation: The insert operation always inserts at index 1, shifting the existing
      elements.
  - answer: '[1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 3]'
    correct: true
    explanation: Each iteration inserts the value at index 1, pushing previous values
      right. The result is `[1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 3]`.
  - answer: '[3, 2, 1, 1, 2, 3]'
    correct: false
    explanation: The elements are inserted in a different order than this choice suggests.
  - answer: '[1, 2, 3, 3, 2, 1]'
    correct: false
    explanation: This answer does not correctly account for the insertion at index

    explanation: The code does not produce an integer result due to a TypeError.
  - answer: '4'
    correct: false
    explanation: The operation fails before returning any length.
  - answer: '1'
    correct: false
    explanation: The length cannot be determined because the code raises an error.

  - answer: s
    correct: true
    explanation: The `ord()` function gets the ASCII value of 'p' (112), adding 3
      results in 115, which `chr()` converts to 's'.
  - answer: t
    correct: false
    explanation: The ASCII value 115 corresponds to 's', not 't'.
  - answer: q
    correct: false
    explanation: The ASCII value 115 corresponds to 's', not 'q'.
  overall_explanation: The `ord()` function retrieves the ASCII value of a character,

    correct: false
    explanation: '`not None` evaluates to `True`, so this is incorrect.'
  - answer: True, False, True, False, True
    correct: true
    explanation: In Python, `0`, empty strings, and `None` evaluate to `False`, so

    function?
- domain: Control Flow
  options:
  - answer: a < b
    correct: false
    explanation: The expression `a < b` checks if `a` is less than `b`, but in this
      case, `a` is greater than `b`.
  - answer: a == b
    correct: false
    explanation: The values of `a` and `b` are not equal, so this condition would
      evaluate to False.
  - answer: a > b
    correct: true
    explanation: The value of `a` is calculated as `7 + 3 * 4 = 19`, and `b` is `7
      + 3 / 1 = 10`. Since `a` is greater than `b`, the condition evaluates to True.
  - answer: a <= b
    correct: false
    explanation: Since `a` is greater than `b`, this condition would be False, and
      'FALSE' would be printed.
  overall_explanation: 'Operator precedence applies here: multiplication happens before
    addition, affecting `a` and `b`''s values.'

  - answer: Cause a runtime exception on Line 9
    correct: false
    explanation: The function call is valid and executes properly.
  - answer: Print 8
    correct: true
    explanation: '`x = 2 + a(x)` calculates `2 + (2 * 1) = 4`, so `a(x)` prints `2
      * 4 = 8`.'
  overall_explanation: The function takes an argument and returns twice its value.
    The new value of `x` is computed before passing it to `a()`.

    correct: false
    explanation: The incorrect order of exception handlers prevents 'a' from being
      printed.
  - answer: The code will cause a syntax error.
    correct: true
    explanation: The generic `except:` block must be placed last in a series of exception
      handlers.

    correct: true
    explanation: Sorting `data` keys lexicographically results in the order `x`, `y`,
      `z`, whose values are `7, 42, 23`.
  - answer: 7 23 42
    correct: false
    explanation: Sorting applies to dictionary keys, not values. The values are accessed
      in the sorted key order.
  overall_explanation: Dictionaries do not maintain order, so sorting the keys results
    in them being accessed in lexicographical order.
  question: "What is the expected output of the following code?\n\n```python\ndata\

  question: What is machine code?
- domain: Data Types
  options:
  - answer: '`not 0` evaluates to `False`.'
    correct: false
    explanation: The `not` operator inverts the truth value, so `not 0` evaluates
      to `True` since `0` is considered `False`.
  - answer: '`not 23` evaluates to `False`.'
    correct: true
    explanation: Since any non-zero number is considered `True`, `not 23` evaluates
      to `False`.
  - answer: '`not ''''` evaluates to `False`.'
    correct: false
    explanation: An empty string (`''`) is considered `False`, so `not ''` evaluates
      to `True`.
  - answer: '`not None` evaluates to `True`.'
    correct: true
    explanation: '`None` is considered `False`, so `not None` evaluates to `True`.'
  overall_explanation: The `not` operator negates the truth value of an expression,
    converting `False` to `True` and vice versa.
  question: Which of the following statements about the `not` operator in Python are
    correct?
- domain: Functions
  options:
  - answer: '[''JA'', ''ST'']'
    correct: false
    explanation: The slicing starts at index `2`, which includes `Mary`, `Jane`, and
      `Steve`, so two elements are missing.
  - answer: '[''JAN'', ''STE'']'
    correct: false
    explanation: This choice includes only the last two names, but the slicing starts
      at `Mary`, so `MAR` should also be included.
  - answer: '[''MAR'', ''JAN'', ''STE'']'
    correct: true
    explanation: The function slices the list from `Mary` onward, then extracts the
      first three letters from each name and converts them to uppercase.
  - answer: '[''MA'', ''JA'', ''ST'']'
    correct: false
    explanation: Each name slice takes the first three letters, not two.
  overall_explanation: The function `get_names()` slices the list from `Mary` onwards,
    and `update_names()` converts the first three letters of each name to uppercase.
  question: "What is the expected output of the following code?\n\n```python\ndef\
    \ get_names():\n    names = ['Peter', 'Paul', 'Mary', 'Jane', 'Steve']\n    return\

    correct: false
    explanation: All variables are correctly named. The issue is related to data types.
  - answer: Mismatched data type(s)
    correct: true
    explanation: The `input()` function returns a string, while the dictionary keys
      are integers. This causes a key lookup failure.
  - answer: None of the above
    correct: false
    explanation: The issue is a type mismatch between the input and the dictionary
      keys.
  - answer: Invalid Syntax
    correct: false
    explanation: The syntax is valid, but a data type mismatch prevents the dictionary
      lookup from succeeding.
  overall_explanation: The `input()` function always returns a string, which must
    be converted to an integer before being used as a dictionary key.

    correct: false
    explanation: 'The code is valid and executes without errors. It correctly defines
      and calls the function `func`.'
  - answer: 2
    correct: false
    explanation: 'The inner call `func(1)` evaluates to `1` (since `1 % 2 != 0` is
      true). The outer call `func(1)` also evaluates to `1`. Thus, the output is not
      `2`.'
  - answer: 1
    correct: true
    explanation: 'The inner `func(1)` evaluates to `1` because `1 % 2 != 0` is true.

    explanation: 'The function returns an integer (`1` or `2`), not `None`. The output
      is `1`.'
  overall_explanation: 'The function uses a conditional expression to return `1` for

  - answer: nums and vals are of the same length
    correct: true
    explanation: 'Since `nums` and `vals` reference the same list, any changes made
      through one are reflected in the other. After deleting an element, both lists

  - answer: vals is longer than nums
    correct: false
    explanation: '`vals` and `nums` refer to the same list object. Deleting an element
      via `vals` reduces the length of both references equally.'

      (mutable), so changes to it inside the function are reflected in the original
      list.'
  - answer: 1 42
    correct: false
    explanation: 'The value of `x` is not modified outside the function because integers
      are immutable in Python.'
  - answer: 3 1
    correct: false
    explanation: 'The first element of `y` is modified inside the function to 42,
      so the output is not `3 1`.'
  - answer: 1 1
    correct: false
    explanation: 'The list `y` is modified, and the first element becomes 42. The
      integer `x` remains unchanged.'
  overall_explanation: 'This code highlights the difference between mutable and immutable
    types. Integers are immutable, so assigning `p1 = 1` does not affect `x`. Lists
    are mutable, so modifying `p2[0]` changes the original list `y`.'
  question: "What is the expected output of the following code?\n\n```python\ndef\
    \ func(p1, p2):\n    p1 = 1\n    p2[0] = 42\n\nx = 3\ny = [1, 2, 3]\n\nfunc(x,\
    \ y)\n\nprint(x, y[0])\n```\n"

  options:
  - answer: one
    correct: false
    explanation: 'The loop increments `i` by 2 each time and prints a star in each
      iteration. It runs twice, not once.'
  - answer: two
    correct: true
    explanation: 'The loop runs twice: first with `i = 0` and then with `i = 2`. Each
      time, it prints a star. The loop ends when `i = 4`.'
  - answer: three
    correct: false
    explanation: 'The loop does not run three times. It only runs for `i = 0` and
      `i = 2`, printing two stars in total.'
  - answer: zero
    correct: false
    explanation: 'The loop runs twice and prints two stars, so the output is not zero
      stars.'
  overall_explanation: 'The loop runs twice: once with `i = 0` and once with `i =
    2`. On each iteration, a star is printed. The loop stops when `i` exceeds 3.'
  question: "How many stars will the following code print to the monitor?\n\n```python\n\
    i = 0\nwhile i <= 3:\n    i += 2\n    print('*')\n```\n"

  options:
  - answer: ace
    correct: true
    explanation: 'The function iterates over every second character in the string
      ''abcdef'' and yields ''a'', ''c'', and ''e'', which are printed without spaces.'
  - answer: An empty line.
    correct: false
    explanation: 'The function yields characters ''a'', ''c'', and ''e'', so the output
      is not an empty line.'
  - answer: bdf
    correct: false
    explanation: 'The slicing `[::2]` selects every second character starting with
      the first, so the output is not ''bdf''.'
  - answer: abcdef
    correct: false
    explanation: 'The function does not iterate over every character. It selects every
      second character, resulting in ''ace''.'
  overall_explanation: 'The slicing `[::2]` selects every second character from the
    string ''abcdef''. The generator yields these characters, and they are printed
    as ''ace''.'
  question: "What is the expected output of the following code?\n\n```python\ndef\
    \ func(data):\n    for d in data[::2]:\n        yield d\n\nfor x in func('abcdef'):\n\
    \    print(x, end='')\n```\n"

# Backing Up Your Mini Project to GitHub

### Step 1: Ensure Your Code is in the Correct Directory

1. Make sure your mini project code is located in your `mycode` directory.
   - If your code is not in the `mycode` directory, move it there now. If you need help with this, let Chad know!

### Step 2: Commit and Push Your Code to GitHub

1. Run the following commands:

   ```bash
   cd ~/mycode
   git add *
   git commit -m "project backup"
   git push
   ```

### Step 3: Get the URL of Your Project File

1. Go to your repository on GitHub at [github.com/YOURUSERNAME/YOURREPONAME](https://github.com).
2. Navigate to the file that contains your project.
3. Open the file and copy the URL from the address bar of your browser. See the picture below.

## You'll paste that link into your survey this morning. Thanks so much everyone!

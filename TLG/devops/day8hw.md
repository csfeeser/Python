### URLS AND QUERIES

Using queries (`?date=2023-07-25`) is a means of returning specific data from an API. Check [api.nasa.gov](api.nasa.gov) and revisit the APOD, NeoWS, or any of the other APIs and try to write URLs using those query parameters to return specific information.
- Put that URL into a Python script to pull the data.
- Print out whatever portion of the data interests.

### RECOMMENDED GENERAL PRACTICE

Continue exploring different APIs and manipulating the data that is returned.
Good URLS to try:

| API Name                                 | API URL                                      | Data Type to Request           |
|------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------|---------------------------------|
| Star Wars API                            | https://swapi.dev/api/people/1               | Neatly display the NAME, HEIGHT, and MASS of this character. Write code that counts up how many films they have been in!  |
| Simpsons Quotes API                     | https://thesimpsonsquoteapi.glitch.me/quotes | Print the quote and the name of the Simpsons character that is returned.                            |
| Pokemon API                               | https://pokeapi.co/api/v2/pokemon | Loop over and print the names of each Pokemon!                              |
| Game of Thrones API                   | https://anapioficeandfire.com/api/characters/583 | Print the NAME of the character, then loop over and display each of their ALIASES.                    |
| "What To Do If You're Bored" API    | https://www.boredapi.com/api/activity | Print the ACTIVITY and number of PARTICIPANTS the activity has. IF there is a suggested activity LINK, display that as well!                          |

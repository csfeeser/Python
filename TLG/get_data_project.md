Looking to work with files? There are lots of cool data sets out there, but Chad already has a bunch you can choose from if you want! Click the link below to see Chad's selection, and below that are instructions on how to download them.

[CHAD'S DATA SETS](https://github.com/csfeeser/Python/tree/master/data%20sets)

1. If you'd like to work with one of these data sets, open the file in GitHub. Then click the `View Raw` or `Raw` button.

0. Copy the url at the top. It should look something like this:

    `https://raw.githubusercontent.com/csfeeser[...]`

0. At the command line, go to the directory where you'd like to save the file. Then type `wget` and paste the URL you just copied.

    `student@bchd:~` `wget WHATEVERYOURURLWAS`
    
**Some ideas for what to do with this data:**
 
 - POKEMON: who has the highest attack rating?
 - ONE PIECE: which is the highest rated episode?
 - COMICS: how many comics feature Wolverine?
 - CARS: which car is most expensive?

## REQUIREMENTS:

- Your script must READ IN data.
- Your script must OUTPUT information from the file in a readable/useful way.

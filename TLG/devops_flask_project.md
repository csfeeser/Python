For your next mini-project, we are going to take what we've learned about APIs, Flask, and Jinja2! Your objective is to write a custom website (topic of your choosing) that meets the following criteria:

- uses Flask and renders HTML visible in a browser
- accepts a POST request and uses the attached data in some fashion
- uses OR creates at least one file utilizing Jinja2 templating

**You may complete this project as part of a group** (no more than three members, everyone must do equal work, code only needs submitted from one group member).

Here is a list of project SUGGESTIONS. You are NOT required to choose from this list... be careful! Some suggestions are more difficult than others! Check with Chad if you are unsure where to begin!

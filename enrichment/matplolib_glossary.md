| Matplotlib  | A comprehensive library for creating static, animated, and interactive visualizations in Python.     |
| Figure      | The "white canvas"- the container that holds all elements of the plot(s), such as Axes, Graphics, Text, and Labels.      |
| Subplot     | A subdivision of the Figure canvas into multiple Axes, each of which can contain a plot.            |
| Axes        | An area of the Figure where data is plotted, complete with labels and ticks.                        |
| X-axis/Y-axis | Horizontal (X-axis) and vertical (Y-axis) planes in a plot used to determine positions in 2D space. |
| Line plot   | A type of plot that connects individual data points with lines to represent trends or progressions.  |
| Scatter plot | A plot that uses dots to represent values obtained for two different variables, showing the relationship between them.  |
| Bar plot    | A graphical display of data using bars of different heights to represent categorical comparisons.   |
| Histogram   | A representation of the distribution of numerical data, grouping values into bins.                  |
| Title       | The heading indicating the subject of the plot, often displayed at the top of the Figure.            |
| X-label/Y-label | Labels that provide context for the data represented on the respective axes.                        |
| Legend      | A guide for deciphering the plots, with each plot typically denoted by a color or a line style.     |
| Grid        | A network of lines that aids in the accurate reading of values at precise positions in the plot.     |
| Style       | The aesthetic design of the plot, which may include variations in line types, colors, and weights.   |

## DICTIONARY CHALLENGE

#### Write a script that does the following:

1. Get your superhero dictionary from yesterday- [CLICK HERE](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1KBJkHZqXF71cwLdfhEb1wxrhnfP9gDAQ/edit?usp=sharing&ouid=110433331379437109513&rtpof=true&sd=true)

0. Paste your dictionary into your new Python file.

0. Write a script that does the following- **YOU CANNOT EDIT THE DICTIONARY DIRECTLY!**

    - Adds another key/value pair to the dictionary
      > example: "fav_food": "chimichangas"

    - Using a *method* from Lab 39. Python Dictionaries, **print** a list of all the **keys** in your dictionary.

    - Ask your user for input. Have them choose one of those keys you just printed. Save their selection as the variable `choice`.

    - Use the variable `choice` to access your dictionary and return the appropriate value.

  EXAMPLE OUTPUT:
  ```
  >> python3 day3warmup.py
  
  ["Real Name", "Base", "fav_food"]
  
  Choose a key:
  > fav_food
  
  Deadpool's fav_food is: chimichangas
  ```

## BONUS:

Dummy-proof your code! If the user types in something wacky, try to accommodate for that!

## SUPER BONUS:

Loop over your list of keys-- display them in a numeric list. Allow the user to type in a number to select the correct key.

Below is the beginning of a script for a "Rock Paper Scissors" game! However, it's incomplete... please try and get it operational!

When working properly, the user should be able to type in rock, paper, or scissors and be told if they won or lost!

**BONUS**- make the script "user-proof"; meaning if the user types in something wrong it won't cause an error, it will just end the game!

**ROCKET SCIENTIST BONUS**- Play multiple times... the winner is the one who scores 2 out of 3 games!

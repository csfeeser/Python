There has been a lot of activity with astronauts going up and down to the International Space Station! There is a public API that records all current people in space and what vessel they are on. Check it out at http://api.open-notify.org/astros.json

**Your challenge this morning is to do the following:**

1. Using the **requests** module, access the API from the link above and pull/translate the JSON!

0. This API changes EVERY SINGLE TIME astronauts leave/arrive in space! Write a script that returns each astronaut and the craft that they are on, which should give the following output:
    
    ```
    People in Space:  7
    Mark Vande Hei is on the ISS.
    Oleg Novitskiy is on the ISS.
    Pyotr Dubrov is on the ISS.
    Thomas Pesquet is on the ISS.
    Megan McArthur is on the ISS.
    Shane Kimbrough is on the ISS.
    Akihiko Hoshide is on the ISS.
    ```

*Do not hard-code "ISS" into your output...* who's to say what other spacecraft our astronauts may fly in someday?

```python
#!/usr/bin/python3

import requests
  
URL= http://api.open-notify.org/astros.json
def main():
    # requests.get() sends GET request to the URL
    # .json() strips JSON off the response and translates into Python!
    resp= requests.get(URL).json()
    
main()

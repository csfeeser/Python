## Previously, you were challenged to write a Flask API that did the following:
  
- A landing page rendered an HTML form asking a trivia question.
- The submitted answer was POSTed to another page
- If the answer was correct, the user was redirected to the "/correct" route
- If the answer was incorrect, the user was returned to the form to try again.

```python
#!/usr/bin/python3

from flask import Flask
from flask import redirect
from flask import request
from flask import render_template

app = Flask(__name__)

html= """<style>
body {
  background-color: black;
  text-align: center;
  color: white;
  font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;
}
</style>
</head>
<body>

<h1>TRIVIA TIME</h1>
<p>What is the meaning of life, the universe, and everything?</p>

    <form action = "/login" method = "POST">
        <p><input type = "text" name = "nm"></p>
        <p><input type = "submit" value = "submit"></p>
    </form>

</body>
</html>"""

@app.route("/correct")
def success():
    return f"That is correct!"

@app.route("/")
def start():
    return html

@app.route("/login", methods = ["POST"])
def login():
        if request.form.get("nm"):
            answer = request.form.get("nm")
            if answer == "42":
                return redirect("/correct")
            else:
                return redirect("/")
        else:
            return redirect("/")

if __name__ == "__main__":
   app.run(host="0.0.0.0", port=2224) # runs the application
```
</details>

## Here is part TWO of this challenge:

- Adapt the script above so that it will accept POSTed JSON, not just an HTML form (see bonus).
- Write a second script, and using the *requests* module, send a POST request containing your trivia answer in JSON.
     - the URL you POST to will be `localhost:2224/whatever/path/you/specified`
- This second (client) script should tell you whether or not your answer was correct!

## How to use requests.post()

```python
import requests

# the URL you wish to post to
url = 'https://alta3.com/login'

# the data you wish to post
ye_olde_dict = {'somekey': 'somevalue'}

# post the data to the URL, capture the response as "x"
x = requests.post(url, json = ye_olde_dict)

# print the text response you get back to confirm all is well
print(x.text)
```

## flask.request Cheat Sheet

```
@app.route("/login", methods = ["POST"])
def login():
        if request.json:
            data= request.json
            if data["nm"] == "42":
                return redirect("/correct")
```

## BONUS:
Your API can STILL ACCEPT HTML form POSTs in addition to POSTed JSON.

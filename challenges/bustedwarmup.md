# Code Repair Challenge!

For this challenge, instead of writing code we'll be repairing it. The code block below uses concepts we've already learned.

1. Create a new file!

    `student@bchd:~$` `vim bustedchallenge.py`
    
    ```
    #!/bin/env python3
    
    greet_user()
    
    # Defined function
    def greet_user()
       user_name = input("Please enter your name: ")
        print("Hello, " + user_name "!")
        print("Welcome to Python class!)
    ```
   
0. As you make changes to fix the script, continue to execute the script to test it. The more errors you see, the more you'll learn how to fix them! Error messages are your FRIEND.

0. Be sure to execute your file with a `./bustedchallenge.py` to discover ALL the errors this code has!

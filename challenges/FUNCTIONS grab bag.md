# Function Grab Bag!

Below are a collection of prompts to create functions! You must choose FOUR (4) to complete!

1. Write a Python function to find the Max of three numbers. 

0. Write a Python function to sum all the numbers in a list. 

    ```
    Sample List : (8, 2, 3, 0, 7)
    Expected Output : 20
    ```

0. Write a Python function to multiply all the numbers in a list. 

    ```
    Sample List : (8, 2, 3, -1, 7)
    Expected Output : -336
    ```

0. Write a Python program to reverse a string. 

    ```
    Sample String : "1234abcd"
    Expected Output : "dcba4321"
    ```

0. Write a Python function to check whether a number is in a given range. 

0. Write a Python function that accepts a string and calculate the number of upper case letters and lower case letters. 

    ```
    Sample String : 'The quick Brow Fox'
    Expected Output :
    No. of Upper case characters : 3
    No. of Lower case Characters : 12
    ```

0. Write a Python function that takes a list and returns a new list with unique elements of the first list. 

    ```
    Sample List : [1,2,3,3,3,3,4,5]
    Unique List : [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
    ```

0. Write a Python function that takes a number as a parameter and check the number is prime or not. 

    ```
    Note : A prime number (or a prime) is a natural number greater than 1 and that has no positive divisors other than 1 and itself.
    ```

0. Write a Python program to print the even numbers from a given list. 

    ```
    Sample List : [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9]
    Expected Result : [2, 4, 6, 8]
    ```

0. Write a Python function that checks whether a passed string is palindrome or not. 

    ```
    Note: A palindrome is a word, phrase, or sequence that reads the same backward as forward, e.g., 'madam' or 'nurses run.'
    ```

0. Write a Python function to check whether a string is a pangram or not. 

    ```
    Note : Pangrams are words or sentences containing every letter of the alphabet at least once.
    For example : "The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog"
    ```

0. Write a Python program that accepts a hyphen-separated sequence of words as input and prints the words in a hyphen-separated sequence after sorting them alphabetically. 

    ```
    Sample Items : green-red-yellow-black-white
    Expected Result : black-green-red-white-yellow
    ```

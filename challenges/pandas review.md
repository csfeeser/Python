- Start by creating a new directory for yourself in ~/mycode. You can name it whatever you want, but if you're not sure try this:

    `mkdir -p ~/mycode/challenge`

- `cd` into your directory.

    `cd ~/mycode/challenge`

- Download a CSV file with some fun data!

    `wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/csfeeser/Python/master/data%20sets/annualcheeseconsumed.txt`

### NOTE: if you want to be extra fancy with the solutions you make, use markdown cells to indicate which part of your code solves each part!
#### Part 1

This data contained the average pounds of cheese consumed per American from 1970 to 2017!

-  Create a dataframe from this data!

#### Part 2

- Set the index to be the YEAR!

#### Part 3

- Reduce the number of columns to just the YEAR and cheddar, swiss, and muenster.

#### Part 4

- Sort the data so that the dates go from MOST recent to LEAST recent.

#### Part 5

- What is the MEAN of all the **cheddar** consumed from 1970 to 2017?

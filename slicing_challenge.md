    challenge= ["science", "turbo", ["goggles", "eyes"], "nothing"]


    trial= ["science", "turbo", {"eyes": "goggles", "goggles": "eyes"}, "nothing"]

1. Start with "challenge" and work your way up!

0. From each list you must pull the strings "eyes," "goggles," and "nothing." YOU MUST USE THE LIST AS WRITTEN. YOU MAY NOT MODIFY ANY OF THE LISTS :)

0. Create a print function that uses those three words *(eyes, goggles, nothing)* that writes out this popular Simpsons quote:

My ***eyes***! The ***goggles*** do ***nothing***!

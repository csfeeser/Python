## CHALLENGE LAB 05:
### DICTIONARIES, VARIABLES, INPUT, SHEBANG

#### Write a script that does the following:

0. Include a shebang line.

0. Make your file executable with a ./

0. Save a user's input to the variable `char_name` from the following question:

        Which character do you want to know about? (Flash, Batman, Superman)
        
0. Save a user's input to the variable `char_stat` from the following question:

        What statistic do you want to know about? (strength, speed, or intelligence)
        
0. Use the `char_name` and `char_stat` values to pull the appropriate value from the dictionary below. 


        {"flash":{"speed": "fastest", "intelligence": "lowest", "strength": "lowest"}, "batman":{"speed": "slowest", "intelligence": "Highest", "strength": "Money"}, "superman":{"speed": "fast", "intelligence": "average", "strength": "strongest"}}

0. You should return an output line that looks like this:

        flash's speed is: fastest
        
**BONUS: When returning the hero's name, have it capitalized appropriately (e.g. Flash, not flash)**

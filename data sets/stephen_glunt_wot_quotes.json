Had I made different choices, some of those dead would be alive.  And others would be dead in their places.  In war, you say a prayer for your dead and ride on, because there is always another fight over the next horizon.  Say a prayer for the dad, Moiraine Sedai, and ride on.",

"quote": "Reasoning with a woman is like sitting down to a friendly game of dice.  Only the woman refuses to acknowledge the basic bloody rules of the game.  A man, he’ll cheat you - but he’ll do it honestly.  He’ll use loaded dice, so that you think you’re losing by chance.  And if you aren’t clever enough to spot what he’s doing, then maybe he deserves to take your coin.  And that’s that.  A woman, though, she’ll sit down to that same game and she’ll smile, and act like she’s going to play.  Only when it’s her turn to throw, she’ll toss a pair of her own dice that are blank on all six sides.  Not a single pip showing.  She’ll inspect her throw, then she’ll look up at you and say, ‘Clearly I just won.’ Now you’ll scratch your head and look at the dice.  Then you’ll look up at her, then down at the dice again.  ‘But there aren’t any pips on these dice,’ you’ll say.  ‘And both dice rolled a one.’ That’s exactly the number you needed to win,’ you’ll say.  ‘What a coincidence,’ she’ll reply, then begin to scoop up your coins.  And you’ll sit there, trying to wrap your head bout what just happened.  And you’ll realize something.  A pair of ones isn’t the winning throw!  Now when you threw a six on your turn.  That means she needed a pair of two instead!  Excitedly, you’ll explain what you’ve discovered.  Only then, do you know what she’ll do?  Then she’ll reach over and rub the blank faces of her dice.  And then with a perfectly straight face, she’ll say, ‘I’m sorry.  There was a spot of dirt on the dice.  Clearly you can see that they actually came up as twos!’ And she’ll believe it.  She’ll bloody believe it!  Only that’s not the end of it!  She scoops up all of your coins, and then every other woman in the room will come over and congratulate her on throwing that pair of twos!  The more you complain, the more of those bloody women will join the argument.  You’ll be outnumbered in a moment, and each of those women will explain to you how those dice clearly read twos, and how you really need to stop behaving like a child.  Every single flaming one of them will see the twos!  Even the prudish woman who has hated your woman from birth - since your woman’s granny stole the other woman’s granny’s honeycake recipe when they were both maids - that woman will side against you.  By the time they’re done, you’ll be left with no coin, several lists’ worth errands to run and what clothing to war and a splitting headache.  You’ll sit there and stare at the table and begin to wonder, just maybe, if those dice didn’t read twos after all.  If only to preserve what’s left of your sanity.  That’s what it’s like to reason with a woman, I tell you.",

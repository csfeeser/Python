### Reasoning for Cuts in Python Network Automation Course

- **100-Level Python Basics**: Removed all foundational Python labs that covered installing Python, basic data handling (CSV, JSON, YAML), and basic data structures (lists and dictionaries). These are core Python skills that network automation students are expected to have beforehand.
- **Redundant and Non-Networking Labs**: Labs covering APIs and basic HTTP requests, web scraping, frontend automation, email automation (which doesn't work in the world of two-factor authentication, and concurrency with HTTP requests were removed. These labs were really just fluff that wouldn't have improved circumstances for networkers just trying to automate their workflow.
- **Non-Essential for Network Automation**: Labs on building APIs with Flask or Django, CI/CD with GitLab, and running Python in containers are better suited for DevOps or web application tracks rather than network automation. 
- **Obsolete or Repetitive Labs**: Removed repeated concepts like handling JSON/YAML multiple times in different contexts and some data analysis tools (pandas and Excel handling) that arenâ€™t critical in a network automation environment.

### Proposed PY202 Outline
- 3 day 200-level python networking course
  - this is adapted from the PYNA course, not the NAPYA course 
- Contains topics that anyone using Python for network automation would need to know

```
# APIs and HTTP
- [ðŸ’¬ APIs and Networking](needs lecture to explain why APIs should even matter to networkers... and none of these labs do anything with networking APIs)
- [ðŸ’» Accessing APIs with requests](this can be the "fun" one)
- [ðŸ’» Networking APIs](lab that uses something like the redfish API container for an actual networking target)

# Network Diagnostics and Analysis
- [ðŸ’» Python for Network Captures and Wireshark](content/pyna/LAB_pyna_python_wireshark_pyshark_captures.md)
- [ðŸ’» Examining Network Capture pcaps Files with termshark](content/pyna/LAB_pyna_using_termshark_for_pcap.md)
- [ðŸ’» Performing ICMP Checks](content/pyna/LAB_pyna_python_icmp_check.md)
- [ðŸ’» Python and Regular Expression for Searching](content/pyb/LAB_regex-intro_re_groups_search-string-parse.md)

# Remote Network Configuration
- [ðŸ’¬ Introducing Paramiko](content/pyna/lec_pyna_paramiko_intro.md)
- [ðŸ’» Paramiko and SFTP](content/pyna/LAB_pyna_python_paramiko_SFTP_with_pass.md)
- [ðŸ’» Automating Commands Across SSH](content/pyna/LAB_pyna_python_paramiko_SSH_with_RSA.md)
- [ðŸ’¬ Python to Cisco NX-OS](content/pyna/LECTURE_pyna_cisco_switch_config.md)
- [ðŸ’» Netmiko for Router and Switch Automation](content/napya/LAB_napya_python_netmiko.md)
- [ðŸ’» Lightweight Database Interactions](content/pyna/LAB_pyna_python_intro_sqlite3.md)
- [ðŸ’» Getting Switch Configuration with NAPALM](content/pyna/LAB_pyna_python_napalm_get_switch_config.md)
- [ðŸ’» Switch Validation and NAPALM](content/pyna/LAB_pyna_python_napalm_switch_validation.md)

# Enterprise Applications
- [ðŸ’» VMWare NSX Automation](content/pyna/LAB_pyna_python_vmware_nsx.md)
- [ðŸ’» scapy - Network Traffic as Code](content/pyna/LAB_pyna_python_scapy.md)

# EXTRA LABS

# Optimizing Code for Automation
- [ðŸ’» Using Argparse](content/pyna/LAB_pyna_python_argparse_argument_parsing.md)
- [ðŸ’» Controlling run time with Environmental Variables](content/pyna/LAB_pyna_python_reading_env_vars.md)
